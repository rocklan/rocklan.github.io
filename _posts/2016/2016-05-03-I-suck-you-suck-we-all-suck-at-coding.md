<p>Programming is hard, but us programmers never like to admit it. Except for the wonderful Scott Hansleman who wrote <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx">this fantastic article</a>. And <a href="https://www.laserfiche.com/simplicity/shut-up-imposter-syndrome-i-can-too-program">on a similar note</a>. And a good explanation on <a href="http://bigcom.com/2016/09/why-your-web-developers-are-grumpy/">why we are all so grumpy</a>.</p>

<p>Oh and did you know that <a href="http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks">programming sucks?</a></p>

<p>And <a href="

<p>Oh and the <a href="http://www.safetyresearch.net/blog/articles/toyota-unintended-acceleration-and-big-bowl-%E2%80%9Cspaghetti%E2%80%9D-code">code for Toyota 2005 Camry is TERRIBLE</a>.</p>

<p>I write this post to assure fellow devs that <b>you are a REAL  programmer</b>. Don't stress about not knowing everything or not knowing enough. There's too much to learn. The time it takes to get good at a language or framework is the time it takes for it to become obsolete! Programming sucks but is great fun. Just don't let it get you down :) </p>
