<p>In a couple of months I'll be <a href="http://ndcsydney.com/speaker/lachlan-barclay/">speaking at NDC Sydney</a> - my topic is "How to change things at your company" - a lightning talk on how to enact change. This is a non technical talk, which is fantastic, because I don't fancy having to answer technical questions from such a tough audience!! </p>

<p>This will be my first "big" conference, and I have to thank <a href="https://larsklint.com/">Lars Klint</a> for his fantastic support in choosing me to speak at the DDD conference last year, which really gave me the confidence to submit a few talks to NDC. I should also link to a great article by Troy Hunt titled <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/speaker-style-bingo-10-presentation/">Speaker Style Bingo</a> which is a killer article that helped me a lot in preparing my talks. Thanks guys!</p>
