Today, I was coding an ASP.NET 4.5 REST api using WebApi 2, and was caught out by a problem caused by a technical decision made forty two years ago.
<br /><br />
I think I need to repeat that again. FORTY TWO years ago. (Yes, it's spelt f-o-r-t-y, not f-o-u-r-t-y, thanks anonymous pedantic reader!)
<br /><br />
1973! The year when Aerosmith released their debut album! The year Elvis Presley's concert in Hawaii had more watchers than the moon landing! 
<br /><br />
Apparently, in ASP.NET, having a URL end in "AUX" causes it to throw a 404 error.
<br /><br />
This might happen if you were building a RESTful web service that validated country codes. For example, you might make a request to this URL
<br /><br />
<pre><code class="html">http://myserver.com/ValidateCountryCode/NZ</code></pre><br />
Which would return "New Zealand".
<br /><br />
Or maybe you're testing Australia:
<br /><br />
<pre><code class="html">http://myserver.com/ValidateCountryCode/AU</code></pre>
<br />
And then of course, you want to test your web service to see what would happen if you passed through invalid country code:
<br /><br />
<pre><code class="html">http://myserver.com/ValidateCountryCode/AUx</code></pre>
<br />
Which gives you a 404 error, thanks to <a href="http://bitquabit.com/post/zombie-operating-systems-and-aspnet-mvc/">CP/M, an operating system coded in 1973</a>.
<br /><br />
What a conundrum! Do I fix it or apply the patch?                          
<br /><br />                                                                                            
Microsoft have a <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2010/04/29/allowing-reserved-filenames-in-URLs.aspx/">fix for this</a>, but it's <b>not enabled by default</b>. Yes, it's NOT enabled by default. Seriously.
