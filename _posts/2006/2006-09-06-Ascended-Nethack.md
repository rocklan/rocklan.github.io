<img src="https://static.lachlanbarclay.net/pics/ascension2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="nethack end" /></a>Wohooo! I have finally managed to "Ascend" (finish) nethack! You can read all about it on my newsgroup post titled <a href="http://groups.google.com.au/group/rec.games.roguelike.nethack/browse_thread/thread/d4ea8fe0ef2b84a5/4a2901c840bc1708#4a2901c840bc1708">First Ascension</a>. It's taken me about 3 years of on-again off-again playing to finish it. I was playing a Barbarian - I can see that I'll now have to try another race - perhaps a Wizard?<br /><br />The screenshot on the right shows the final endgame level - click on it for the full-sized version.

<p>This was my first time into the elemental (and astral) planes so it was an adventure!</p>

<p>Here's a couple of highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li> Jubilex was rather easy... he was already dead!
Not sure how I managed this, but it was a bones
level - this was actually my "big break" because I
managed to pick up something like 3 magic
markers that hadn't been re-charged, and heaps
of other goodies like rings and scrolls.
</li>
<li> I played this game over a period of four weeks.
Including last night, when I went to bed just as
I landed on the astral plane! (It was too late
and I would have made a stupid mistake!)</li>

<li>I managed to kill Rodney 6 times, including
when he cast "Double Trouble". The last time
he had stolen my amulet, and I was hovering over
some water (Medusa level I think). So I had to
drop everything and dive in :)</i>

<li>I think that I was very fortunate on the
Elemental planes. I didn't have any portal detection
devices except for the amulet. Somehow I didn't have
any trouble with water elementals and I even managed to
kill one.. somehow! I think that the ring of conflict
made my life a lot easier :)</i>

<li> I killed 5 master mind flayers before genociding them :) </li>

<li> I killed death twice, both times with my cleaver,
however he wasn't guarding my altar. Famine was,
and I didn't have to deal with Pestilence :)</li>

<li> On the Astral Plane, I walked into into a doorframe
and was confronted by famine! There were ants behind me
and my food was in a bag. Took a crazy swing and killed
him with one hit! Using only my basic +5 Cleaver! I think
that my ring of conflict must have made my life a bit easier :)</li>

<li> This was the first time I'd ever seen an Archon - putting
a towel over my eyes made things a lot easier!</li>

<li> Never had an amulet of life saving :) (Or a ring of
regeneration)</li>

<li> Never wrote Elbereth :)</li>

<li> Didn't polymorph anything, including myself. Never really
had the need to (but I'm not really against it... as yet)</li>

<li> Got a score of 4325374 - my best so far!</li>

<li> Took 81943 moves - how does that stack up?</li>

<li>183 HP (could have sworn it was more like 210 at one point)</li>

<li> Character was level 22, AC -29, St 25, Dx 18, Co 18,
In 17, Wi 18, Ch 16. I don't think that I ever casted any
spells (except to make me confused when neccesary) </i>

<li> I forgot to make a copy of my inventory to note down.</li>

<li> One thing I've never worked out. How do you
take only 1 item out of a bag? If it's stacked?</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyway, big big thanks to the DevTeam for creating
an awesome game, and a big thanks to everyone on
r.g.r.n - I think I spent just as much time googling
for nethack info as I spent actually playing the game :)</p>
