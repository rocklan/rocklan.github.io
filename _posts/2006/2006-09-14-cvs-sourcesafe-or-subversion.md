Today I learnt something. Doing a:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cvs tag MyTag ../code<br /><br />gives you a glorious error:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protocol error: `../data/src' has too many ..<br /><br />Now the obvious workaround;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cd ..<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cvs tag MyTag code/<br /><br />which works fine!<br /><br />Now typically this wouldn't be a problem, however I was running this job within ANT, and since I don't know a lot about ANT, I couldn't figure out how to change the current directory. I spend ages trying to figure out how to do this. Apparently, you can't. I think that it's not actually ant's fault, it's more of a java problem. But what would I know.<br /><br />I think that CVS is becoming a little bit too ragged around the edges. There's no support, there's no way of renaming files and keeping history, renaming a directory will make your life hell, there's no list of bugs, and there's no searchable forum for help. Erguhgh. Plus there's no nicely integrated web front-ends. Yes I'm sure that you can install one.. but that's just another thing that you're going to have to hassle with.<br /><br />I've used sourcesafe before and it worked ok. But trying to automate any of it was a bastard.<br /><br />Methinks subversion is the way to go. Maybe next project.<br />
