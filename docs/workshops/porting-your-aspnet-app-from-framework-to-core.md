## Summary

After moving a bunch of my own applications to dotnet core, I realised that there was an easy road to take, and a hard road to take. Moving your framework application to dotnet core doesnâ€™t have to be a dangerous experiment. By slowly moving your application across, one class at a time, you can make life easy for yourself and your users.
