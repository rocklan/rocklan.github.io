Over the past few years I've been running workshops over Zoom to train fellow developers. My particular areas of interest are performance and porting code from framework to core.

When code is running slow, most people start guessing at what the problem is, based on their previous experience. The problem is it's so easy to be wrong, and you can waste a huge amount of time fixing the wrong stuff! So how do you take the guesswork out and start making measurable differences? Visual Studio's profiler is a killer tool for working out what's slow. This workshop will cover the profiler extensively and give you the tools to make huge performance improvements to your app.
