## Dedication

I dedicate these recollections to [Arthur James Lovick](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lovick-186) and Florence Adele Lovick (nee Munday). My Mum and Dad, who with their love and care, made a happy childhood for me at no. 26 Tweedside st Essendon.

### Arriving.

My Mother walked the two blocks to the Hospital, when I was arriving. I was their first child. We had no car or phone, and my Father was at work. As it was the start of the great depression, and to have a job was so important he couldn't jeopardize it by staying away for any reason, as there were so many ready to take his place. I suppose he came home after work, and finding Mum missing he assumed I'd arrived. His story was that at the hospital, the sister approached him with a baby on each arm, and after telling him that one of them was his daughter, he reached out for the cute little fair-skinned baby, only to be told the screaming red-faced ugly one was me. What a shock... that is all I heard of this event, but he did add later, "the ugly ones turn out the best looking in the end". Mum of course didn't agree with his first impression, she saw me with a Mothers eyes, and said I was beautiful all along. But this is all hearsay, but as I did hear this story many times accompanied by much laughter, I guess it's true. 

### The House.

I lived for the first twenty years of my life, at 26 Tweedside street Essendon. I was born on the 19th of September, 1929, just a few streets away, at a small Hospital called Landersle. It was a rented house, as the depression prevented many young couples from owning their own home. The house was a brick veneer, with a stucco finish. It had a lounge room,dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and two bedrooms. My young Uncle slept in a sleep-out on the front verandah, which had roll down canvas blinds. Outside away from the house was the washhouse, the lavatory, and further on, Dad's shed. There was a big lemon tree, a plum tree, and lots of vegetables and flowers. This is the stark outline of the house and garden, but to make a house a Home, it takes more than bricks and mortar. What it takes is love, and we had that aplenty. 

An only child, I was of reality the focus of my parents attention but they were determined I shouldn't be "spoilt", so they were very strict. I couldn't get away with blaming anyone else for my misdemeanours. But I had a lot of playmates in our quiet little street, so I never ever felt lonely. What you don't have you never miss. We played most days after school, and after tea in the good weather, until twilight. Games of tiggy, skippy, hoppy, hide and seek etc. Then home to my cosy little bedroom, to read and reread some of my Christmas books. Dad would come in with his guitar, and we'd have our nightly sing along with Mun singing too from somewhere in the house.

The house as I've said was rented, and needed a lot of repairs, which no-one ever did in the twenty years we lived there, so Dad did the kalsomining of the walls, and all the small repairs. 

### Our Family.

My family was a small one, just Dad, Mum and me. I had no brothers and sisters to knock me into shape, in preparation for life's inevitable ups and downs. But I did have loving parents, who provided me with a safe and secure home, which by today's standards would seem lacking in material possessions. My Dad (whom I adored), was Arthur James Lovick. 

A gentle man, born in the suburbs, and living there all his life. But in his heart he was yearning to live in the country, and join his cousins, those men of Snowy mountain fame, galloping on their horses, down steep tracks, and living a life rural. But it never happened, and he didn't dwell on it, making the best of what he had. Always an optimist, he taught me to see the best in people, and to see both sides of an argument. This can annoy people, as they want you to take sides. I remember him in those early years, tall and slim, thick brown wavy hair, and deep blue eyes. He loved music, and played the piano, guitar and ukulele. He taught me hundreds of songs, and he played and sang every day of his life. He was by trade a carpenter, but had to give it up because of the depression of 1928, and join his brother in his butcher shop, much to his Mothers dismay, who didn't want him to join all his forebears, who'd all been butchers, she wanted something different for her Jimmie. 

Mum who loved us both dearly, was made of sterner stuff, and had the job of licking us both into shape. It was a case of two against one, as she pointed out to us many times. She'd been born near Kalgoorlie, and her Father was goldminer, who'd died of the miner's complaint, and their life was very hard. 

She brought her dying Mother to Melbourne for treatment, and met Dad, and that was the start of their story. 

She was fairly short and a little plumpish, with thick black hair, good skin, but always had to wear glasses. She had a good singing voice, and we had many a sing-song around our precious piano. I loved her, but we were chalk and cheese in many ways, but we three had many a happy time, at number 26 Tweedside st. 


### The Lounge Room.

The lounge room or front room at Tweedside Street, was mostly out of bounds. It was used for my weekly piano lessons and special occasions. I was not allowed to take a friend in there to play. I remember the same thing at my Grandmothers house, where my cousin and I would sneak into the forbidden front room, with its aspidistras and antimacassars, the silence broken only by the steady *tick tock tick tock* of the clock on the mantelpiece. 

Ever since I've hated a noisy clock in a quiet room, it spells boredom and uneasiness to me. But back to the piano lessons. My teacher was an eccentric from a family of musicians, who lived for music, true artists all. She came to the house, a thing unheard of today, clothes flapping, wild hair, and a strange manner, I don't remember how she arrived, but if it was by broomstick, it would have fitted her exactly, but she was a good teacher, and I enjoyed my lessons. She would sit in a chair beside my piano stool, and rap on the keys and the music with a pointer. She kept time by rocking back and forth, rubbing her hands rhythmically along her thighs, and uttering a strange noo noo sound, I got used to it and thought it quite normal. We would play duets, and she'd finish with "now I want you to practise for an hour each day, starting with all your scales." We had to put the piano on the side of the room with the good floorboards, as there were a few creaking ones, that Dad said could go at any time. We sometimes had friends around for cards, and the front room was aired and prepared, card tables dusted off, supper ready. It was my job to pass the savouries, cakes and the sugar. 

This was all very exciting, until with a sinking heart, I had to do my party piece on the piano, goodness knows what the visitors thought, but good manners prevailed. Another occasional activity in the lounge room was the showing of movies on a white sheet hung on the wall. My uncle had given me a projector for a birthday present, and a relative who worked as a film distributor would send us bits of disconnected film. I thought this was magic, and we'd all sit engrossed watching silent movies on the wall. 

Another time Mum threw a party for my Uncle who lived with us 'til he married. Perhaps it was his twenty first. I was allowed to stay up as a special treat. What a contrast to today's parties, no alcoholic beverages here, just lemonade and tea, but they did have fun, playing spin the knife, singing around the piano etc, all good clean fun. So this was a slice of life in a room of another time, that good or bad will never come again. 

### The Dining Room. 

The Dining room, cum family room, at Tweedside Street was the most used room in the house. In it, I could entertain my friends, as the front room was out of bounds. Dad, Mum and I ate our breakfast, lunch and dinner on a big old wooden table, and in winter a fire in the old-fashioned grate kept the room very cosy. It had lovely old tiles of birds and flowers surrounding it, that I never tired of looking at. 

Mum's Singer sewing machine stood in one corner, and the clatter of the treadle as she mended or made some garment, formed a background to other activities in the room. Perhaps Dad playing the guitar or doing the crosswords, and me reading. I was very young, when one day I decided to put on a one woman show for my audience of two, I hung a curtain on the door between the dining room and the hall, for my entrances, and gathered an assortment of props and costumes. Using Mums hats, scarves dresses shoes etc. I wrote a program, and settled the audience, and the show began. I can't remember what I performed, something I'm sure copied from my heroes Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin. There were none of the pre show jitters or forgotten lines that plagued me in later years, just the knowledge that I was a star and a huge hit with the audience. As an adult I did do many a show on the amateur stage, plays and musicals, but I don't think I ever held the audience in the palm of my hand as much as that day long ago, when I put on a one woman show for the best audience I ever faced. 

### The Kitchen. 

In the kitchen Mum said "clear the sink, the ice-man's coming". "Oh beaut" I said, "can I have the ice-chips for putting in our cocktails." My friend Nancy and I, about eight and nine years old, on a Saturday arvo, copied our heroes of the silver screen, acting out scenes from recent movies, aping the glamorous stars like Hedy Lamarr, Joan Crawford, Lana Turner etc. and THEY always had cocktails. Ours were squashed purple grapes, that hung over the back fence, strained to remove the seeds and skins, and mixed with a little sugar and water, and topped with the precious ice chips had us sipping like movie queens.. "Hmmm cocktails, what next" said Mum with a bit of a grin, "anyway here he is, open the back door."

"Come in" I said, and in he came, big and burly, with the huge ice-block balanced on a piece of Hessian on one shoulder, ready to be cut to fit the new ice-chest. Mum was very pleased to have this new addition to her kitchen, as previously we'd had to rely on a Coolgarclie safe hanging in the lemon tree to keep food cool. 

For those who don't know how these work, here's a description as well as I can remember. It was a cupboard with a wooden frame, about three foot deep and two feet wide, covered on the sides and the door with flywire. The top had a recessed metal tray filled with water, hessian pieces dipping in the water hung down on all sides. The hessian soaked up the water, and as the breezes blew through the wet sides the food inside was cooled. We could set jellies and junkets inside, meat would keep very well for a short time, as long as a blowie didn't get in. 

The ice-man said "Good'ay Mrs Lovick, nice day". He lowered the ice block, hessian and all, as if it were as light as a feather, and put it gently on the wooden draining board of the sink. He pulled the sharp ice-pick from his leather belt, and proceeded to deftly chip the block in two. He slid our half into the top of the ice-chest, and scooped up the other to deliver next door. "See ya next time" he said, and with a wink at Mum "how's the two Movie Stars?"

We ignored this, and gathered up the ice pieces, and mixed up our cocktails. How sophisticated we felt, sipping our drinks, and acting out recent scenes seen at the flicks, when we'd begged or borrowed the money for a Saturday afternoon matinee.

Of course the kitchen was the hub of the house from which all good things emanated. Mum boiled up jam in the summer time, plums and apricots from our trees in the backyard, the big preserving pan bubbling away as she wiped the perspiration from her face with her pinny, stirring away with the wooden spoon, not the best time to make jam. In the winter Dad made scrumptious soups, using the good meaty bones from the butcher shop. 

"This'll put hair on your chest Luce" he used to say. One Christmas, after I'd spent ages looking at all the gee-gaws in my stocking, They said "there's something else Father Christmas left in the kitchen, it wouldn't fit down the chimney", and there, propped up against the back door was a brand new shiny red Cyclops scooter. This was my mode of transport for many a year. Then as I outgrew the scooter, once again propped up at the door was a bicycle. I remember saying to Dad "I'll never want anything ever again", I was so happy. He said "we'll see", with a grin. 

My Uncle's hobby was making model aeroplanes which he used to hang from the ceiling in the kitchen, hitting all grown-ups on the head. Mum threatened to rip them down many a time, but she never did. So many activities happen in and around kitchens in all homes, these are just a few from mine.

### The Washhouse and the Garden and the Blot. 

As you walked down the path from the kitchen, you came to the washhouse, where the Monday washday ritual was strictly adhered to. Inside in the corner, the copper for boiling the clothes stood, firmly encased in a brick surround. Next to it was the twin troughs, for rinsing, blueing and starching. On the shelf above were the knobs of Rickets blue, in their red white and blue wrappers, their little strings ready for dangling in the final rinse. Too much blue and it showed on the sheets and pillowcases, but with experience, a dazzling white was achieved. 

Also on the shelf was the packet of Silver Star Starch, for starching all the things that had to be ironed later when dry, to a crisp smoothness. The copper was filled with water, and the fire lit in the grate below. Then Velvet soap was grated into the water and the things that could be boiled plunged in. When the water boiled my Mother would stir vigorously with the copper stick. When she was sure all were clean, they were lifted into the trough to rinse, then into the final blue water. She used the washboard to wash things by hand, rubbing up and down on its wavy sides using soap and plenty of elbow grease. After starching pillow cases, Dads collars, and his white butchers coat, all would be hung on the line to dry. Finally the copper water was emptied by hand with a dipper. No wonder Mum was a bit tired out on a Monday night. 

But my friend Nancy and I had another use for the washhouse, for this was the headquarters of our club, the J.G.G's or the Junior G.Girls. Dad had made a board to fit over the troughs, and this is where we did all our detective work. We'd write a storyline at school to be acted out when we got home. Our favourite bad guy was the BLOT, who always left his trade mark at the scene of the crime. 

We would prepare these blots, putting a big ink spot in the middle of a piece of paper, and then folding it in half, and getting, (we thought) mysterious markings. We would leave them in different locations in the garden and pretend to find them, acting out the days script. We kept a book with everybody's finger prints in, and our magnifying glass worked overtime. We dearly wanted a pair of hand cuffs, but didn't know how to get them. We were in a different world, on a different plane, our imaginations working overtime. 

Dad had a garden shed further down the path, in it was the hand mower, his gardening tools, and my favourite thing, a musical saw, on which a plaintive tune could be played, by sitting down and placing the handle between your knees, bending it slowly back and forth, and hitting it with a little wooden mallet. The apricot tree was laden in the summer with big luscious fruit, as was the plum tree, the source of all our jams. Sometimes we played with the other kids in the street, but the best games were about the BLOT, and the J.G.G.'s our own creation.
