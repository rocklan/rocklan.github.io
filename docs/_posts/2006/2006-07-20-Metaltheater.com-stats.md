Yesterday metaltheater.com reached over 200 sessions in a day, which is the highest yet! Since the start of the year the site has steadily grown in readers - the graph on the right shows unique sessions per day.<br /><img src="https://static.lachlanbarclay.net/pics/stats.png" alt="Metal Theater.com unique sessions per day" /><br />What a fluke huh? Who would have thought!<br /><br />So what have I done to increase traffic? Numerous things. First off, I did my best to make the site all valid HTML, conforming to the w3c strict standard. I also looked up as much info as I could about making my site "google friendly". Then I added as many reviews as I could (a lot more to come!), got a few links from wikipedia, added an RSS feed (this is quite popular), and lately I've started doing interviews, which has been a nice boost.<br /><br />Search engines used to find my site:<br /></p><ul><li>google.com - 65% </li><li>search.msn.com - 11%</li><li>search.yahoo.com - 6%</li></ul><p>Google is still king! Browsers used:</p><ul><li>Mozilla / Firefox - 49%</li><li>IE - 21%</li><li>	Opera - 1%</li><li>Safari - 1%</li></ul><p>So thanks everyone for reading the site, I'm going on holiday for a week so don't expect anything new until I get back :)<br /><br />I notice that <a href="http://www.paulgilbert.com/News.html">Paul Gilbert</a> has a new instrumental CD coming out - that will be a <b>must buy</b> for all shred-heads.<br /><br />The <a href="http://richmurray.typepad.com/">Guitar Channel</a> has kindly linked to my Brett Garsed interview, and they also have lots of nice reviews and articles, so please check it out!
