Last Tuesday my band <a href="http://www.mp3.com.au/TwinParadox">Voice Of Apollo</a> played a gig at <a href="http://www.revolverupstairs.com.au">Revolver Upstairs</a>. I had the usual dramas; when we were setting up my amp kept on showing "er". It's never done that before, so I was really panicking. Turns out it was because I had it plugged into the wrong input jack on the cabinet (8 ohms instead of 4 or something) - and the head was smart enough to tell me so. Still gave me a few worries while we were setting up! Next time I'd better bring along a distortion pedal in case something goes majorly wrong with my head :)<br />

Craig was playing through a Yamaha rig which gave him a great sound - lots of top and bottom end. But the best thing about the show was that Randall's bass drum was miked up - so we had some nice double pedal madness! He was also playing a Yamaha kit and he tells me that it was really nice. It was also the second gig in which I was playing the 7 string, so that was cool. <br /><br />

I'm always worried about how people will react - I think I've hung around too many indie-rock losers who abhor guitar solos. Well <b>SCREW THEM</b>. I only did a few solo's (2 or 3) and they actually received applause! Next time it's going to be even more finger tapping madness and crazy fretboard antics.<br /><br />

You're the reason the gig was fun! We made a few (obligitory) mistakes;<br /><br />- I cut off Craig's bass solo way too early (sorry mate), as I thought he only wanted a few bars (I think I only gave him two, dur)<br /><br />- We stuffed up the ending of the last song, but Randall covered it really well<br /><br />- We also slightly stuffed up the intro to the last song, but we got away with it.<br /><br />
