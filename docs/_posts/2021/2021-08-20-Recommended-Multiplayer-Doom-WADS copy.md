title: Recommended Multiplayer Doom WADS
readtime: true
---

For a while now a bunch of friends and I have been playing co-operative Doom using custom WADS. These WADS are utterly incredible, vastly improving the original doom with mind-blowing map design, new monsters, new weapons, new sounds & new puzzles. The amount of things that can be done with the Doom engine is amazing, and people are constantly pushing the limits. 

So why co-op? We started off playing deathmatch but found that playing co-op was more fun. Working together in Survival Mode to beat a map forces a lot of cooperation and planning, and there's a lot more at stake when you're on your last life!

Now finding good co-op maps is difficult. There's thousands to choose from and you don't want to waste your time on the boring ones. Some of them aren't designed for cooperative play. A lot of the time I would go through the [Cacowards](https://www.doomworld.com/cacowards/), pick out a few and try them out, but even then it's a bit of a guess into what is good. Some of them are just too hard, some are too easy... it's a difficult balancing act.

The following is a list of WADS that we have played so that we can keep track of what we've done, and what we'd like to play next. 

#### Awesome co-op / survival wads that are strongly recommended

* [Eviternity](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/103425-final-release-eviternity/) - massive, incredible Mega WAD. Freaking awesome. 
* [Valiant](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Valiant)  - Skillsaw is a genius
* [Sunlust](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Sunlust) - Fun, amazing, very 'dark and moody' though.
* [Toke's Coop Build](http://www.doom2.net/toke/) - Old school WAD with some great ideas. Super creative.
* [Lost Civilisation](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/105215-lost-civilization-22-map-fun-and-nonlinear-megawad-now-with-download-link/) - Utterly fantastic WAD
* [Ancient Aliens](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Ancient_Aliens) - Amazing WAD. Awesome new monsters, storyline and quirky. So much fun.

#### Other WADS that were good fun 

* [Destination Unknown](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/deathmatch/skulltag/du_se)
* [DoomWare](https://zandronum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=7919) - This is one CRAZY WAD. Hilarious, but gets boring pretty quickly!
* [Antaresian Reliquary](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Antaresian_Reliquary) - Really good, if a bit unbalanced... MAP04 will absolutely kick your butt. We spent 3 weekends on it!!
