Remember those cool games in the 80's where you shot everything in sight? Those were the best games. The music was sometimes pretty cool too - and made even better when bought into the present with some MASSIVE GUITARS.<br /><a href="http://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com" target="_blank"><br /><img src="https://static.lachlanbarclay.net/pics/schmups.jpg" alt="Shoot 'Em Ups" class="img-responsive" /></a><br /><br />This collection features Doom 2, Commander Keen 4, R-Type, Ghouls and Ghosts, Double Dragon, and two tunes from the obscure Japanese PC only shoot-em-up games named Touhou! <br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />1. <a target="_blank" href="http://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com/track/deep-mountain-touhou-7-stage-1">Deep Mountain (Touhou #7 Stage 1)</a> - 03:06<br /><br />This is the first song that I'd recorded in a while. I went for a different approach with contrasting between the clean guitars and then the monstrously heavy 7-string, and then back to the acoustic. Compositionally wise it's pretty simple, just repeating the main melody 3 times, but it's the arrangement that (hopefully) makes it interesting. Ideally I would have liked to expand the heavy section, but in a short burst it leaves you wanting more.<br /><br /><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aYzGK8gcqGE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br /><br /><br />	<br />2. <a target="_blank" href="http://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com/track/love-coloured-master-spark-touhou-8-stage-4">Love Coloured Master Spark (Touhou #8 Stage 4)</a> - 01:55<br /><br />It's very hard to do justice to the original with this version, so I went for an electronic drum sound similarly to the original, but threw in a keyboard solo at the end because I found such a rad patch. No I can't play the keyboard for nuts. Not yet anyway.<br /><br />	<br />3. <a target="_blank" href="http://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com/track/r-type-medley-arcade" >R-Type Medley (Arcade) </a> - 06:24<br /><br />Phew, the first monster. I really wanted to do at least one song from R-Type, so I downloaded all of the music and listened to a bunch of them.. then decided, the more the better right?? So what we've got here is about 5 or 6 stages all thrown together. It was a bit of a nightmare trying to piece them all together into one coherent bit of music - so I basically separated it into medium tempo and fast tempo ones. I'm really proud of the first 40 seconds because that's where the weird time signatures occur! (Though it's all a matter of interpretation, you could argue that it's all 4/4... Mike and I disagree). I decided to do a videoclip for this one:<br /><br /><div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JH3kT0xPE8M" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br /><br />	<br />4. <a target="_blank" href="http://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com/track/eat-your-vegetables-commander-keen-4" >Eat Your Vegetables (Commander Keen 4) </a> - 01:57<br />I borrowed a friends awesome Warwick bass for a few of these songs and wanted to make good use of it. After playing through Commander Keen 4 for the seven hundreds time (classic game, much better then all the Mario's combined) I decided to do a cover of the super sleazy sounding "Blowfish Tune". It took a while to come up with a good arrangement, and I ended up sticking with almost exactly the same instrumentation as the original, minus a few things. Keeping it sparse added a real cool factor to it.	<br /><br />	<br />5. <a target="_blank" href="http://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com/track/ghouls-and-ghosts-c64-version-stage-1" >Ghouls And Ghosts (C64 Version Stage 1) </a> - 03:15<br /><br />In-tune with the game, this one was devilishly hard. The original is such a fantastic song that doing a cover of it seemed like a tragedy... so I ended up doing a bit of both. Most of the song is actually there in the background so this is almost a re-mix not a cover! <br /><br />	<br />6. <a target="_blank" href="http://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com/track/dave-d-taylor-blues-doom-2-stage-8" >Dave D Taylor Blues (Doom 2 Stage 8) </a> - 05:17<br /><br />I've loved this song for years, all the way back to playing Doom 2 on my 486 DX40. It's actually just a really simple 12 bar blues. I tried to replicate the original almost exactly here - even making sure the triplet echo's on the guitar were spot on. For this tune I miked up the amp instead of using Amplitube - what do you think of the tone? <br />	<br /><br />7. <a target="_blank" href="http://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com/track/double-dragon-medley-snes" >Double Dragon Medley (SNES) </a> - 07:43<br /><br />ARGHGHGHG. FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT. Smash his head in! Take that! <br /><br /><br />You can download the <a href="http://lachlanbarclay.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">Shoot Em Ups Album</a> for free!
